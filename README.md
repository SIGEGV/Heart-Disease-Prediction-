# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model


Machine Learning Project: Heart Disease Prediction.
Project Goal:
Developed a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease in individuals based on their medical data and lifestyle factors.

Technical Skills:

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed relationships between features and the target variable (presence/absence of heart disease) using various visualization techniques.
Model Selection and Training: Implemented and compared different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to identify the best performing model for predicting heart disease risk.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Feature Importance Analysis: Determined the most significant features influencing the model's predictions.
Key Achievements:

Achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy percentage] in predicting heart disease risk.
Developed a user-friendly web application interface for deploying the model and allowing individuals to assess their own risk score.
Identified potentially important risk factors for heart disease through feature importance analysis.
Impact:

This project has the potential to contribute to early detection and prevention of heart disease, a leading cause of death worldwide.
The web application can empower individuals to take proactive steps towards maintaining cardiovascular health.
